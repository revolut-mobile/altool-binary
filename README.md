# altool-binary

A repository to host binaries of the altool cli. Find the binaries in [the releases section of the repository](https://github.com/revolut-mobile/altool-binary/releases)

## Why is this useful?

The `altool` bundled with Xcode 13.2.1 [is buggy](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/699749). As a workaround, it is possible to use the `altool` binary bundled with an older version of Xcode. This repository is used to host such binary
